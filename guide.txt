Hello! This guide will help you add the new project templates to your portfolio.

I have added 20 pre-made project templates with placeholder data to your website's code. They are currently commented out so they don't show up on your live site.

**How to activate and edit your new projects:**

1.  **Open the data file:** Navigate to the file at this path in your project: `src/lib/data.ts`

2.  **Find the commented-out projects:** Scroll to the bottom of the file. You will see a large block of code that starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`. This is where your new project templates are.

3.  **Uncomment the projects:** To make them appear on your site, simply delete the opening `/*` and the closing `*/` markers. Make sure you don't delete any of the actual project code between them.

4.  **Edit the content:** Once uncommented, you can start editing the content for each project. Here is a breakdown of the fields you can change for each project object:

    - `id`: A unique identifier. It's best to keep this unique for each project (e.g., 'my-new-app-2024').
    - `slug`: This is used in the URL for the project's case study page (e.g., `yoursite.com/projects/my-new-app`). Keep it short, descriptive, and use dashes instead of spaces.
    - `title`: The title of your project.
    - `category`: The category filter. Use one of 'Web', 'Mobile', 'UI/UX', or 'VA'.
    - `description`: A short description that appears on the main projects page card.
    - `longDescription`: The detailed description that appears on the case study page.
    - `imageUrls`: An array of URLs for your project screenshots. The first image is the main one on the project card. Replace the `https://placehold.co/...` URLs with direct URLs to your own images. You can add as many as you like.
    - `tags`: A list of technologies or skills used (e.g., 'React', 'Node.js', 'Figma').
    - `liveSiteUrl`: The full URL to the live, deployed project. If you don't have one, you can remove this line.
    - `sourceCodeUrl`: The full URL to the project's repository on GitHub or another platform. If you don't have one, you can remove this line.

**Example of editing a project:**

```javascript
// Before
{
    id: 'project-template-1',
    slug: 'project-template-1',
    title: 'Project Template 1',
    // ... other fields
    imageUrls: ['https://placehold.co/1200x675.png'],
    tags: ['Tag1', 'Tag2'],
},

// After
{
    id: 'my-cool-social-app',
    slug: 'my-cool-social-app',
    title: 'My Cool Social App',
    // ... other fields
    imageUrls: ['https://your-image-host.com/social-app-screenshot1.png', 'https://your-image-host.com/social-app-screenshot2.png'],
    tags: ['Next.js', 'Firebase', 'Tailwind CSS'],
    liveSiteUrl: 'https://my-cool-social-app.com',
    sourceCodeUrl: 'https://github.com/your-username/my-cool-social-app',
},
```

That's it! Just uncomment and edit, and your portfolio will grow with your skills.
